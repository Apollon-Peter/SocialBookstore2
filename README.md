This was a college project which aimed to **better** our **code development** along with **Spring Boot** framework.  
A half finished project was given, in which the code needed **corrections, additions and refactoring** for better **readability, understanding and functionality**.  

These and the tests were developed by our team of 2:  
* Apollonas Petros Kallipolitis  
* Ioannis Giannakos  
  
In order to execute the program:  
* changes need to be made (most likely) in the application.properties file in order to set it up with mysql properly  
* execute the contents of the myy803_socialbookstore-static.sql file inside of mysql as a query  
* execute the src\main\java\myy803\socialbookstore\SocialbookstoreApplication.java file
